Print all the numbers in between 1 and 10,000,000, in the numerical order, that are the product of two distinct primes. Please print the numbers together with the primes whose product is the resultant number (e.g. 6=2*3 \n 10=2*5 \n 14 = 2*7 \n 15=3*5 \n ....). The requirement is as follows:  
(1) Using standard C/C++.  
(2) Runnable on a 4GB machine.  
(3) Good human readability and easy to maintain.
